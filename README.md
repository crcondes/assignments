This is a selection of programming assignments I completed in college, uploaded
as a small demonstration of my programming ability.

lab7:
The purpose of this assignment was to create a dictionary ADT based on a binary
search tree structure.

asg-2: 
For this assignment, all of the files were provided with the skeleton of the 
code written, and the assignment was to fill it in and make the various 
operations work properly. The project was a Reverse Polish Notation calculator
using "bigints" to represent arbitrarily large numbers. 

The provided code is in the folder "original", and most of the changes involved 
implementing the bigint type, which stored numbers as an unsigned bigint (a 
string of characters) and a sign, either positive or negative. The mathematical
operations had to be rewritten to use this representation. Not all of the 
operations were fully functional as of the assignment's due date, and this is 
noted in the project's README.
