This is a selection of programming assignments I completed in college, uploaded
as a small demonstration of my programming ability.

**lab7:**
The purpose of this assignment was to create a dictionary ADT based on a binary
search tree structure. This was for the Introduction to Data Structures class.

**sum15/cs101/pa5:**
This assignment built on two other assignments in the class on Algorithms and 
Abstract Data Types. 
The List and ListTest files created an doubly linked list data type with a 
cursor.
The Graph, GraphClient, and GraphTest files utilized the List assignment to 
create a graph from an input file and represent it using an adjacency list.
The purpose of pa5 was to use the Graph program to analyze a given graph and 
find strongly connected components using depth-first search. All of the test 
files provided worked correctly, as noted in the project's README.

**sum15/cs109/asg-2:**
For this assignment from Advanced Programming, all of the files were provided 
with the skeleton of the code written, and the assignment was to fill it in and
make the various operations work properly. The project was a Reverse Polish 
Notation calculator using "bigints" to represent arbitrarily large numbers. 

The provided code is in the folder "original", and most of the changes involved 
implementing the bigint type, which stored numbers as an unsigned bigint (a 
string of characters) and a sign, either positive or negative. The mathematical
operations had to be rewritten to use this representation. Not all of the 
operations were fully functional as of the assignment's due date, and this is 
noted in the project's README.
